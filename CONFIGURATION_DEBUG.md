# üö® CRITICAL GitHub Pages Configuration Issue

## The Problem is Confirmed
Your GitHub repository is running **TWO deployment workflows**:
1. ‚úÖ Your custom "Deploy to GitHub Pages" (failing)
2. ‚ùå Automatic "Deploy Jekyll with GitHub Pages dependencies" (also failing)

This proves GitHub Pages is still set to "Deploy from a branch" instead of "GitHub Actions".

## ‚úÖ EXACT STEPS TO FIX

### Step 1: Verify Current Configuration
1. Go to: https://github.com/shbmhmd/my-portfolio/settings/pages
2. Check what "Source" is currently set to

### Step 2: If Source Shows "Deploy from a branch"
1. Click the dropdown under "Source"
2. Select "GitHub Actions" 
3. Click "Save"

### Step 3: If Source Already Shows "GitHub Actions"
The issue might be browser caching or GitHub's caching. Try:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Wait 10-15 minutes for GitHub's cache to clear
3. Try accessing the site in an incognito/private window

### Step 4: Force Repository Refresh
If the above doesn't work:
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone" 
3. Temporarily disable GitHub Pages
4. Wait 2 minutes
5. Re-enable GitHub Pages with Source: "GitHub Actions"

## üîç Evidence of the Issue
- Jekyll workflow is auto-running (should only happen with branch deployment)
- README.md content is being served (Jekyll converts it to HTML)
- Custom GitHub Actions workflow exists but result is ignored

## Expected Result After Fix
- Only "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow should run
- No Jekyll workflow should trigger
- Your React portfolio should deploy correctly

Please check your GitHub Pages settings and confirm what the Source is currently set to.

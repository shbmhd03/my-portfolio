## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Netlify account
- Node.js and npm installed
- Git repository

### Steps
1. **Install Netlify CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Login to Netlify**:
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

4. **Initialize Netlify site**:
   ```bash
   netlify init
   ```

5. **Deploy to production**:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

### Environment Configuration
The system uses Netlify Functions which automatically handle:
- Serverless function deployment
- CORS headers
- Environment variables
- Build optimization

## Usage

### Accessing Admin Panel
- **Enhanced Admin**: Navigate to `/admin` for full content management
- **Legacy Admin**: Navigate to `/web-admin` for basic functionality

### Content Updates
1. Login to admin panel
2. Navigate to desired section
3. Edit content using the rich text editors
4. Save changes - they reflect immediately on the live site

### Project Management
1. Go to Projects section in admin
2. Add new projects with all details
3. Upload images and add links
4. Mark projects as featured for homepage display

### Blog Management
1. Access Blog section in admin
2. Create new posts with rich content
3. Organize with categories and tags
4. Publish/unpublish posts as needed

### Maintenance Mode
1. Go to Maintenance section in admin
2. Toggle maintenance mode on/off
3. Set custom messages and duration
4. Changes apply globally instantly

## Development

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test Netlify functions locally
netlify dev
```

### Adding New Content Types
1. Update `netlify/functions/content.js` with new data structure
2. Add API methods in `src/api.ts`
3. Create admin interface components
4. Update `DynamicPortfolio.tsx` to display new content

## Security

### Admin Authentication
- Password-based authentication for admin access
- Session management with localStorage
- Admin routes protected from maintenance mode

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization on all forms
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Error handling for API calls

## Performance

### Optimization Features

# Upload Portfolio to New GitHub Account

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create New Repository on GitHub
1. Go to your new GitHub account
2. Click "New Repository" or visit: https://github.com/new
3. Repository name: `my-portfolio` (or any name you prefer)
4. Description: `Modern React Portfolio with Admin Panel`
5. Make it **Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Configure Git for New Account
```powershell
# Set your new GitHub account details
git config user.name "YourNewUsername"
git config user.email "your-new-email@example.com"
```

### 3. Add New Remote
```powershell
# Remove old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Verify the new remote
git remote -v
```

### 4. Push to New Repository
```powershell
# Push all branches and history
git push -u origin main

# If you get authentication errors, you may need a Personal Access Token
# Go to: GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
# Generate new token with "repo" permissions
```

### 5. Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to your new repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Pages" section
4. **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions" (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. **Custom domain**: Enter your domain (if you have one)
6. **Enforce HTTPS**: Check this option
7. Click "Save"

### 6. Update Domain Configuration (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Update the CNAME file in `public/CNAME` with your domain
2. Configure your domain's DNS to point to GitHub Pages
3. GitHub Pages IPs: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153

### 7. Verify Deployment
After pushing, GitHub Actions will automatically:

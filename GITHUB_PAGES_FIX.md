# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: GitHub Pages Configuration Required

## The Problem
Your website is currently showing a Jekyll-generated page from README.md instead of your React portfolio. This is because GitHub Pages is set to "Deploy from a branch" instead of "GitHub Actions".

## âœ… SOLUTION: Configure GitHub Pages Source

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
1. Open your GitHub repository: https://github.com/shbmhmd/my-portfolio
2. Click on the **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Change Source to GitHub Actions
1. Under **Source**, you'll see it's currently set to "Deploy from a branch"
2. **Change it to**: "GitHub Actions"
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
- Source: **GitHub Actions** âœ…
- Custom domain: **mohamedsuhaib.live** âœ…
- Enforce HTTPS: **Checked** âœ…

## What This Will Fix
- âœ… Stop serving Jekyll-generated content from README.md
- âœ… Start serving your React portfolio from GitHub Actions workflow  
- âœ… Enable proper deployment of built assets from `dist` folder
- âœ… Fix progress bars and all portfolio functionality

## After Configuration
1. The next push to `main` branch will trigger the correct deployment
2. Your portfolio will be fully functional at https://mohamedsuhaib.live
3. All features including progress bars will work correctly

## ðŸ”§ Manual Configuration Required
**This change must be made in the GitHub web interface - it cannot be done via code/API.**
